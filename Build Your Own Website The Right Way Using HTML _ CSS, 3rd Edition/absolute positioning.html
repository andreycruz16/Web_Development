		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<p><span id="brand">Bubble Under</span> is a group of enthusiasts based in the south-west UK who meet up fot diving trips in the summer months whaen the weather is good and the bacon rolls ae flowing. We arrange weekends away as small groups to cut the sosts of accomodation and travel and to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive buddy.</p>
		<p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't dtay on our town turf: past diving weekends away have included trips up ti Scupa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's numerous wreck sites.</p>
		<p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local to talk avout our recent adventures (<em>ANY</em> excuse, eh?)</p>
