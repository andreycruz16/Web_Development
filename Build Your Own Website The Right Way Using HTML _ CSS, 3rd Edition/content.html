		<h2>Welcome to our super-dooper Scuba site</h2>
		<p><img src="scream.jpg"></p>
		<p>Glad you could dorp in and share some air with us! You've passed your underwater navigation skills and successfully found your way to the start point - or in this case, our home page.</p>
		<h3>About Us</h3>
		<p>>Bubble Under is a group of diving enthusiasts based in
		 the south-west UK who meet up for diving trips in the
		 summer months when the weather is good and the bacon
		 rolls are flowing. We arrange weekends away as small
		 groups to cut the costs of accommodation and travel and
		 to ensure that everyone gets a trustworthy dive
		 buddy.</p>
		 <p>Although we're based in the south-west, we don't stay on
		 our own turf: past diving weekends away have included
		 trips up to Scapa Flow in Scotland and to Malta's
		 numerous wreck sites.</p>
		 <p>When we're not diving, we often meet up in a local pub
		 to talk about our recent adventures (any excuse,
		 eh?).</p>
		 <h3>Contact Us</h3>
		 <p>To find out more, contact Club Secretary Bob Dobalina on
		 01793 641207 or
		 <a href="mailto:bob@bubbleunder.com">email
		 bob@bubbleunder.com</a>.</p>
