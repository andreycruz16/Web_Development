		<h1>Low and Slow</h1>
		<p>This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique
		called sous vide. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food
		(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is
		precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be
		cooked to. In his book, Cooking for Geeks, Jeff Potter describes
		it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p>
		<p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill
		Hollandaise. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us
		before November 30.</p>

		<p> Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized. Avoid it
		if you are pregnant or have immunity issues.</p>
