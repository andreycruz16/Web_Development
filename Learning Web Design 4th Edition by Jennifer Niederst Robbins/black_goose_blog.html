			<p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited
			about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous
			vide</i></dfn>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking,
			you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in
			plastic) into a water bath that is precisely
			set to the target temperature of the food. In
			his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff
			Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature
			poaching</q>.</p>
			<p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide
			Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve
			a seat at the chef table, contact us before
			November 30.</p>
			Location: Bakerâ€™s Corner, Seekonk, MA
			Hours: Tuesday to Saturday, 11am to midnight
